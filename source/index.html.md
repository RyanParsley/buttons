Buttons are a pretty big deal on the internet. Sure, less talked about
than kittens. Can pushing a kitten upload an image of a kitten? No. Push
ing a button can, however upload an image of a button. Buttons >
Kittens.

Here are some buttons I've made with CSS3. The only images harmed in the
making of these buttons are for texture purposes. I hope you find them
useful.
